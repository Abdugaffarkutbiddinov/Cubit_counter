<b><h2> BLoC Architecture Startup Project </h2> </b>

Hello everyone and welcome back! 

This repo is going to serve as a starting project for every application I will build on my <b> BLoC - From Hero to Wizard </b> Tutorial Series on my <b> [Flutterly YouTube Channel](https://youtube.com/c/Flutterly)  </b>

<b><h2>  About the structure of the project </h2></b>

- <b> ðŸ”¹ Pure Startup project </b>
- <b> ðŸ”¹ Organised Folder Structure </b>
- <b> ðŸ”¹ Required BLoC Dependencies </b>
- <b> ðŸ”¹ Generated Routing </b>
